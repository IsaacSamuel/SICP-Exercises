# SICP Exercises

There comes a time in every young programmer's life where tutorials and documentation are not enough; he or she wants to learn more about the deep, underlying truths that govern computing itself. It's not enough to use a language well; how do we build one? What are the different paradigms of computation itself? We smile warmly, encourage them for being proactive on their path to engineering maturity, and finally point this programmer to *Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs*. We trust that it will keep them busy for a year, by which point they most probably will have job-hopped for a 15% raise in salary, and they won't come to us with their annoyingly earnest questions anymore. We sip our coffee and get back to our JIRA ticket.

These are selected exercises for *SICP*, the classic in computer science literature. It uses MIT's Scheme language, a derivative of LISP.
